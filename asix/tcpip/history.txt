// AX11000 Firmware Revision History
// Module Name: TCPIP
//
// This document describes the major changes, additions and bug fixes made 
// to the AX11000 Firmware between released versions. 
//======================================================================
Version 1.0.9  (2010-09-24)
1. Add the function to check the tcp connection existed after keep-alive function was enabled.

Version 1.0.8  (2010-04-19)
1. Add some functions to support un-listen and un-bind feature.

Version 1.0.7  (2009-11-10)
1. To fix a software issue in transparent mode when the ax110xx has not set up
   the arp entry of gateway and got a frame from outside of the local LAN,
   it create a wrong arp entry (gateway¡¦s ip and another station¡¦s mac address).

Version 1.0.6  (2009-08-24)
1. To fix the the issue (in transparent mode) that the subnet mask of
   AX110xx was set in B Class, and the PC (in the same subnet mask) sent an
   ping request packet to AX110xx through router. The AX110xx must send arp
   request frame to query the PC's mac address because having not relative arp
   entry in the arp table, but it sent the ping response to gateway directly
   (because the uip create a new arp entry that maintain the PC's ip address
   and gateway's Mac address).
2. To fix one issue of arp table in transparent mode. When no empty arp entry
   in arp table, and driver got a new ip address, software always stores the
   this ip to the last arp entry.
   
Version 1.0.5  (2008-12-03)
1. To avoid the tcpip module treating 00:00:00:00:00:00 as the gateway MAC
   Address when gateway IP Address is 0.0.0.0 and try to search the MAC Address
   from ARP Table.

Version 1.0.4  (2008-07-22)
1. Modified the release type of this module.

Version 1.0.3  (2008-06-03)
1. Fixed lib's bug that the lib can not reset the tcp socket when this tcp
   socket is in re-transmit state.

Version 1.0.2  (2008-04-22)
1. Fixed a issue of tcpip stack that tcpip module does not handle the tcpip data
   frames with FIN+PSH+ACK in tcp flag.

Version 1.0.1  (2008-04-09)
1. Use one dummy byte to occupy xdata memory at address 0 to avoid the tcpip
   module allocates a tcp or udp socket for applications, but the socket
   start address is at address 0.

Version 1.0.0  (2006-11-13)
1. Initial release
